# Final Projects

The Open Source Studio final project, ideally collaborations of 2-3 students, is a contribution to an open source project (or the creation of a new open source project.)

Contributions can be made through a Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP fork (using the process outlined in the [data assignment](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus/blob/source/data-assignment.md)) or to the  project directly.

## 1: Ideas

The first step is to generate a list of possible ideas for contributions (or new projects). Don't worry whether it's an idea that you want to do, you might find something that someone else in the class wants to work on. In addition, this is an exercise in evaluating how open source projects communicate their needs and welcome new contributors.

You can use these lists to search:
* [Projects listed as "Great for New Contributors"](https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors)
* [Projects listed as "Awesome for Beginners"](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)
* [Google Summer of Code Organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/)

You might also try these open source projects that are affiliated with ITP in some capacity:
* [The Processing Foundation](https://github.com/processing/)
* [ml5.js](https://github.com/ml5js)
* [Knitting Machine](https://github.com/knittingmachine/)
* [Open Source Studio](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP) - the class itself is an open source  project?

Also, the projects from the "case studies" or guest speakers are possibilities.
* [Case Studies](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Case-Studies)
* [p5.js Web Editor](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/)
* Improving accessibility of educational resources at ITP
* [dev.to](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to)
* [Distributed Web of Care](https://github.com/tchoi8/distributedwebofcare)

### Assignment - Due Oct 23

1. [File at least one GitHub issue](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Final-Projects/issues) with an idea for a contribution (or new open source project). Try to be specific, point to a feature, issue, or elements of the project's documentation.
2. Respond to at least two other issues with a comment. Is it realistic? Are you interested?

## 2: Proposal - Due Nov 6

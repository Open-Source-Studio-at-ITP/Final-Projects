# Final Project Proposal Presentation

## Presentation

Here are some guidelines for your final project proposal presentation. While your presentation is limited to 10 minutes and will inevitably be less detailed, please use the [final documentation template](final-template.md) to organize your presentation. Practice what you want to say and show, highlighting key elements. 

## Feedback

We will spend 5-10 minutes critiquing your presentation. This is not a typical critique given the focus on open source. Here are some guidelines (adapted from a guide by Marina Zurkow).

### For the presenter:

1. Prepare a clear and specific statement of what you tried to achieve.
2. Be clear about what you were able to accomplish and what you were not.
3. Consider what you want to get out of the feedback. Prepare open-ended questions that get at specific aspects of your project.
4. Decide for yourself what feedback is relevant. Check your bias for only hearing the feedback you want to hear. 

### For providing feedback:

Your job is to help the creator(s) of the project understand whether they met their goals and how they might move forward with the project beyone the class. Can you separate your personal taste and world view from your feedback?

1. Do you understand what was accomplished?
2. Did it meet the goals that the presenter stated?
3. Is there an insight, something new?
4. Does it address a real need?
5. In what ways does the project fall short of its goals?

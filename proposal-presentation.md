# Final Project Proposal Presentation

## Presentation

Here are some guidelines for your final project proposal presentation. Note that even if you are creating an new open source project (rather than contributing to an existing one), you can frame your proposal as a specific set of goals that are part of a larger initiative.

Your presentation should take ~5 minutes and will inevitably be less detailed [than your proposal](proposal-template.md). Practice what you want to say and show, highlighting only key elements. For example:

1. What is the open source project?
2. What is your contribution to the open source project for this final?
3. Who is the audience for this project? 
4. What need / gap does this project fill?
5. What are your deliverables?
6. Do you have an idea for a mentor to review your work? ([See mentor guidelines](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Final-Projects/blob/source/mentor-guidelines.md))
7. What help do you need? What other questions do you have?
8. If a collaboration, how do you plan on working together?

## Feedback

We will spend ~5 minutes critiquing your presentation. This is not a typical critique given the focus on open source. Here are some guidelines (adapted from a guide by Marina Zurkow).

### For the presenter:

1. Know what you want to get out of the feedback. Prepare open-ended questions that get at specific aspects of your project youâ€™re unsure of.
2. Decide for yourself what feedback is relevant. Check your bias for only hearing the feedback you want to hear.

### For providing feedback:

Your job is to help the creator(s) of the project meet their goals. Can you separate your personal taste and world view from your feedback?

1. Do you understand the open source project?
2. Do you understand the specific goals of the contribution as it relates to the larger open source project?
3. Is the proposal specific, especially in terms of deliverables?
4. Is the project realistic in scope?
5. What will be some stumbling blocks for the project to meet its goals?
6. Does the contribution offer something new?

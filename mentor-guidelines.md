# Mentor Guidelines

Mentorship is a key ingredient for open source contributions and new projects. Ultimately the primary mentorship for each project falls on the instructor of this course (Daniel Shiffman), however, it would also be useful for each project to have feedback and guidance from a subject area expert or open source project maintainer that can offer a different perspective.

Each final project can seek out its own mentor or ask the instructor to facilitate finding a mentor. Mentors will receive a small honorarium for their participation.

Following are the expectations set by the class for mentorship:

1. A review of the project proposal with feedback in the form of e-mail, video chat, or IRL meeting.
2. A review of project progress on or about the week of November 26th in the form of e-mail, video chat, or IRL meeting.
3. A review of the completed project report (details TBA) with feedback in the form of e-mail, video chat, or IRL meeting.

The above are our minimum requirements. If possible a weekly check-in about project progress is preferred. In addition, mentors are invited to the final project presentation session on Tuesday, December 11th, but attendance is not at all required.

It is the hope that the relationship established and work developed during the final project period will extend beyond the class, however, there is no requirement that mentors continue their involvement after reviewing the work.
